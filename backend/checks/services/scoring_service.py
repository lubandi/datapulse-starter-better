    Weighting by severity:
        HIGH = 3x weight
        MEDIUM = 2x weight
        LOW = 1x weight

    Steps:
    1. Map each result to its corresponding rule
    2. Calculate weighted pass/fail for each check
    3. Compute overall score as weighted average (0-100)
    4. Return dict with score, total_rules, passed_rules, failed_rules

    Example return:
        {"score": 85.5, "total_rules": 5, "passed_rules": 4, "failed_rules": 1}
